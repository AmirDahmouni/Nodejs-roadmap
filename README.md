# ðŸš€ Nodejs Roadmap

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

# v8 enginer
The V8 library provides Node.js with a JavaScript engine (a program that converts Javascript code into lower level or machine code that microprocessors can understand), which Node.js controls via the V8 C++ API. V8 is maintained by Google, for use in Chrome.

npm is the standard package manager for Node.js
